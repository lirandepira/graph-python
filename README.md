### graph-python
The file karate.edgelist.txt contains an undirected graph represented in terms of an edgelist

This code implements the following:
- reads the file
- creates a dictionary containing the adjacency list of the graph
- implements the functions edge_count(), incident_edges(v), insert_edge(u,v), u and v being two nodes of the graph.
The insertion of a new edge can take place only an edge between nodes u and v does not exist.
